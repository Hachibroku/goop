2023-08-14  to 2023-08-15
During these two days, I engaged in the planning phase using Excalidraw. My focus was on delineating endpoints and outlining the primary features for our upcoming app

2023-08-21 to 2023-08-23
I spent quality time collaborating with team members during this period. Our significant achievement was building a log-in and log-out authentication system.

2023-08-24 to 2023-08-25
I dedicated these days to code development, specifically creating the CRUD functionalities for our "Topic of the Day" feature.

2023-08-28 to 2023-08-30
Over these three days, I focused on the voting system. I employed CRUD operations to effectively create this feature, ensuring smooth user interactions.

2023-08-31 to 2023-09-01
I honed in on endpoint development during this period. The goal was to establish efficient endpoints for both the "Topic of the Day" and the voting system.

2023-09-04 to 2023-09-06
The start of September saw me writing unit tests specifically for the "Topic of the Day" endpoints. Alongside this, I took the opportunity to rectify and enhance sections of our code that needed attention.

2023-09-07 to 2023-09-08
These days were heavily centered on front-end tasks. I delved into the topicsection.js file and implemented necessary code adjustments to improve functionality.

Today was quite productive. I successfully integrated the voting system into our TopicDetail.js file, marking a pivotal development in our project.
